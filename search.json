    "text": "Date: 2025-10-22\nModel(s): ChatGPT (LLM)\nWhat worked better as I added pages.\nExpanding to a multi-page structure clarified what belongs on each page and reduced cognitive load on the reader. The navbar gave me a stable mental model—Home for quick context, Resume for depth, Projects for evidence, Skills/Certs for proof, and Contact for calls-to-action. Using an LLM helped me brainstorm section labels, write first drafts fast, and surface alternative phrasings. The biggest win was idea-generation and rewording; it saved time and helped me keep a consistent tone across pages.\nEnsuring authenticity and accuracy.\nI treated the LLM’s output as a starting point, never as the source of truth. I replaced general phrasing with my real data: titles, dates, responsibilities, and the exact tools I used. I verified every claim against my resume and coursework, removed anything that sounded generic or unearned, and added context from my own experience—especially metrics and outcomes where I had them. I also included an Appendix that stores the prompts and the unedited LLM drafts to make the AI contribution transparent.\nWhat I’d improve next.\nI will add richer evidence (links to PDFs, brief case write-ups), collect concrete metrics for my highlights, and refine accessibility (alt text, heading order, contrast). I also plan to experiment with another theme and add a simple site search. Overall, the multi-page site feels more professional and scannable; the LLM is most helpful for brainstorming and polishing, while accuracy and voice are my responsibility."
